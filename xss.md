# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Explained

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can execute in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive information or session hijacking.

## How XSS Works

1. **Injection Points:**
   - Attackers exploit input fields, URL parameters, or other user inputs where unsanitized data is echoed back to the page.

2. **Malicious Payloads:**
   - Injected scripts are typically JavaScript code that can capture user data, manipulate the page's content, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

3. **Execution in User's Browser:**
   - When a victim accesses the compromised page, the injected script executes in their browser, giving the attacker access to their session data or other sensitive information.

## Types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS (Persistent XSS):**
   - Malicious scripts are permanently stored on a target server, often in a database. When users access the affected page, the script is retrieved and executed.

2. **Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent XSS):**
   - Malicious scripts are embedded in URLs or other inputs, and the victim unknowingly triggers the execution when they click on a crafted link or visit a manipulated page.

3. **DOM-based XSS:**
   - The attack occurs entirely within the victim's browser, where the Document Object Model (DOM) is manipulated by injecting malicious scripts to alter page content dynamically.

4. **Self-XSS:**
   - Social engineering technique where attackers trick users into executing malicious code in their own browser console, thinking they are performing a legitimate action.

## Prevention Measures

1. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs to ensure they do not contain malicious scripts.

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   - Implement CSP headers to restrict the types of content that can be executed on a web page.

3. **Secure Coding Practices:**
   - Encourage secure coding practices to developers, such as output encoding and proper input validation.

4. **Session Security:**
   - Use secure session management practices to minimize the impact of session hijacking.

5. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities.

Understanding and addressing XSS vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining the security of web applications and protecting user data.
