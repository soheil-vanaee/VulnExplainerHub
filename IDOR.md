## Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): Explained

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a system or website allows a user to access a specific object or data, but fails to enforce proper access controls. In IDOR, an attacker gains unauthorized access to information or resources that they are not supposed to have access to.

### How IDOR Works

1. **Object Reference in Requests:**
   - The system typically provides access to resources or information using an identifier (ID) or a specific address.

2. **Lack of Proper Access Checks:**
   - The system does not properly check or incorrectly enforces the user's access rights.

3. **Unauthorized Access to Resources:**
   - The attacker, by manipulating the object reference or changing the ID, gains access to resources or information they are not authorized to access.

### Examples of IDOR

1. **Changing Object IDs in URLs:**
  - Requests related to resources may have IDs in the URL. An attacker may gain unauthorized access by altering these IDs.

```url
Example:
https://example.com/user/profile?id=123
```

2. **Modifying POST Request Values:**
- If values in POST requests on the client side are modifiable, an attacker can change these values to gain access to unauthorized resources.

```http
POST /change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user_id=123&new_email=attacker@example.com
```

Prevention Measures
Use Appropriate Access Policies:

Ensure that the system utilizes proper access policies and roles for users.
Utilize Security Tokens:

Implement tokens or digital signatures to validate user identities.
Thoroughly Check Requests:

Scrutinize requests carefully and use effective authentication mechanisms.
Encrypt Sensitive Information:

Ensure that sensitive information is protected using proper encryption.
Preventing these vulnerabilities is crucial to avoid unauthorized access to sensitive information and maintain system security
